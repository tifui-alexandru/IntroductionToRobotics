Homeworks from the "Introduction to Robotics" laboratory taken at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest.

# Homework 1 - Light up an RGB led

## Components

* RBG led (1 minimum)
* potentiometers (3 minimum)
* resistors and wires (per logic)

## Task Requirement

Use a separat potentiometer in controlling each of the color of the RGB led (Red, Green and Blue).  The control must be done with digital electronics (you must read the value of the potentiometer with Arduino, and write a mapped value to each of the pins connected to the led).
